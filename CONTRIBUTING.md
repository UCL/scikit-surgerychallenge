## Design Considerations

1. As few dependencies as possible. Try to stick to standard packages.
2. Discuss extra dependencies with the team and maybe the outcome will be to create a new separate package, where you can be more specific and more modular.
3. Unit test well, using pytest, with good coverage.
4. All errors as exceptions rather than return codes.


## Coding guidelines

1. Make sure that tests passes. You may disable specific warnings within the code where it is reasonable to do so
2. Include comments to make your code easily understandable.
3. Add unit tests for new and modified code
4. Make sure all existing and new tests pass
5. Make sure your code works for all required versions of Bash
6. Make sure your code works for all required operating systems
